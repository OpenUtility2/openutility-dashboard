# OpenUtility Dashboard

> **Your Discord. Under control.**

The official web dashboard for **OpenUtility Bot** — a modern control center for Discord server security, moderation, logging, automation, configuration, and utilities.

OpenUtility Dashboard is designed to give server owners a clean, focused interface for managing their OpenUtility-powered servers without relying on a large collection of commands.

- 🛡️ **Security Center** — Security status, threat information, Anti-Nuke controls, and protection settings.
- 🚨 **Anti-Nuke & Recovery** — Protection workflows, emergency controls, trusted users, and recovery features.
- 🤖 **AutoMod** — Configure spam, invite, link, mention, caps, duplicate-content, and related protections.
- 👋 **Welcome Studio** — Configure welcome and leave messages, embeds, variables, images, DMs, and auto-role behavior.
- 🔨 **Moderation** — Manage moderation settings and review moderation cases and activity.
- 📋 **Advanced Logging** — Configure organized logging for messages, members, moderation, commands, and security events.
- 🎨 **Embed Builder** — Create Discord embeds with a visual workflow and live preview.
- ⚙️ **Server Configuration** — Centralized configuration for OpenUtility features.

## 🏗️ Architecture

OpenUtility uses separate components so the dashboard, API, and Discord bot can evolve independently.

```

The dashboard is the presentation layer. Server-side authentication, persistent configuration, and Discord API operations belong in the companion API/backend rather than being exposed in the browser.

## 🚀 Development

This repository is primarily a browser-based web project and does not require a Node.js build step for the static dashboard pages.

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenUtility2/openutility-dashboard.git
cd openutility-dashboard
```

### Run locally

Use any static HTTP server. For example, with Python:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

You can also use VS Code Live Server or another static development server.

## 🔐 Authentication & API

Authentication and protected Discord operations should be handled by the **OpenUtility API**.

The dashboard can act as the frontend while the backend handles:

- Discord OAuth2 authentication
- Session management
- Discord API requests
- Server discovery
- Permission checks
- Persistent server configuration
- Secure bot-token handling

Never place Discord client secrets, bot tokens, session secrets, or other private credentials in frontend HTML or JavaScript.

## 🌐 Deployment

The dashboard is configured for the custom domain:

```text
https://openutility.bot.nu/
```

For static hosting, make sure the hosting provider serves the repository root and preserves the directory structure used by the dashboard.

If authentication is enabled, configure the corresponding Discord OAuth2 redirect URI in the Discord Developer Portal and keep OAuth secrets exclusively in the backend environment.

## 🎯 Design Goals

OpenUtility Dashboard is built around a few principles:

- **Simple** — important controls should be easy to find.
- **Professional** — consistent UI, spacing, typography, and interaction patterns.
- **Security-focused** — sensitive operations belong behind appropriate permissions and server-side checks.
- **Discord-native** — the dashboard should feel natural to Discord server owners.
- **Modular** — features should be independently maintainable.
- **Open source** — the project remains transparent and community-friendly.

## API endpoint configuration

The dashboard reads its backend base URL from `api-config.js`. The default is the production API URL. To point a deployment at another backend, change `window.OPENUTILITY_API_BASE` in that file; keep the value as the API base ending in `/api`. The backend must set `FRONTEND_URL` to the exact dashboard origin and use HTTPS. Authenticated write requests use session-bound CSRF tokens.
